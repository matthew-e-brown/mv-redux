# Matrix/Vector library for WebGL

This library/package/bundle of scripts&mdash;however I end up releasing
this&mdash;is a rewrite of some of the `Common` scripts that are distributed as
part of the 8th edition of
[_Interactive Computer Graphics with WebGL_][book-repo].

I'm rewriting these to provide current and future students of _COIS-4480H:
Computer Graphics_ at Trent University, which I'm assisting with, with a nicer
foundation with which to do their labs and assignments. The current code samples
included with the textbook are... of dubious quality, sadly. Not only are they
written in ancient JavaScript, but there are several bugs when you start to use
them beyond their most basic level[^2].

[^2]: I can't blame the authors, though, since their README mentions some
struggles against the publisher.
